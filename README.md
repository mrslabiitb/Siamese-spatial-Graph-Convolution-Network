# Tensorflow-Siamese graph convolutional network for content based remote sensing image retrieval

* This is a simple siamese MLP network with Tensorflow
* Retrieval MAP value of 81.79(%)	and precision at top-10 retrieval of 97.14(%) on the benchmark PatternNet dataset.
* Retrieval MAP value of 69.89(%) and precision at top-10 retrieval of 93.63(%) on the benchmark UC-Merced dataset.
* MLP network is built based on TensorFlow on top of the fully-connected features obtained from Graph Convolution Network (https://github.com/nsk1001/multi-label-analysis)
